    <h1>Algebra Formulas</h1>
    <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics that substitutes letters for numbers. An algebraic equation depicts a scale, what is done on one side of the scale with a number is also done to either side of the scale. <br> The numbers are constants. Algebra also includes real numbers, complex numbers, matrices, vectors and much more. <br> X, Y, A, B are the most commonly used letters that represent algebraic problems and equations.</p>
    <h2>List of the formulas are given below-</h2>
    a <sup>2</sup> - b <sup>2</sup> = (a -b) (a + b)
    <br>
    (a + b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup>
